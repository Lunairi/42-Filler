# 42-Filler

Second algorithm branch project, make a player for a game called Filler, current in progress, will post progress as they get completed. 

Day 1 progress (about 2 hours)

Completed: Parsing filler_vm stdin
Incomplete: Placing pieces on board
In Progress: Piece placing algorithm, identifying pieces
Note - So far I only spent a short time on this, I'll probably be able to finish this quickly. I've messed around with filler stuff to make sure I understand how the filler_vm works for the game.

Day 2 progress (about 8 hours)

Completed: Parsing filler_vm stdin, placing pieces of board, identifying pieces
Incomplete: 
In Progress: Piece placing algorithm behavior
Note - Took awhile to revisit this project, had other stuff to do. Today was a bigger jump, was able to add functional piece placing. Plan to create a few different placing algorithm behavior, at the moment the piece only places in the bottom right quadrant. Will be adding other behaviors and using some sort of identifier to determine which algorithm it should use to behave (and it will go through all behaviors in the event one behavior won't place)

Day 3 progress (about 30 minutes)

Completed: Parsing filler_vm stdin, placing pieces of board, identifying pieces
Incomplete: 
In Progress: Piece placing algorithm behavior, visualizer draft
Note - I was working on another project and also did not sleep in over 30 hours, decided to write a quick visualizer draft. Too tired to keep fixing it, why seg fault.

Day 4 progress (about 2 hours)

Completed: Parsing filler_vm stdin, placing pieces of board, identifying pieces, visualizer
Incomplete: 
In Progress: Piece placing algorithm behavior
Note - Completed the visualizer I started when I was up super late because I couldn't fall asleep. Fixed the visualizer to look nice, now aiming to work on behavior. May optimize the visualizer for faster speed.
