# 42-Filler

Second algorithm branch project, make a player for a game called Filler, current in progress, will post progress as they get completed. 

Day 1 progress (about 2 hours)
- Completed: Parsing filler_vm stdin
- Incomplete: Placing pieces on board
- In Progress: Piece placing algorithm, identifying pieces
- Note - So far I only spent a short time on this, I'll probably be able to finish this quickly. I've messed around with filler stuff to make sure I understand how the filler_vm works for the game.

Day 2 progress (about 8 hours)
- Completed: Parsing filler_vm stdin, placing pieces of board, identifying pieces
- Incomplete: 
- In Progress: Piece placing algorithm behavior
- Note - Took awhile to revisit this project, had other stuff to do. Today was a bigger jump, was able to add functional piece placing. Plan to create a few different placing algorithm behavior, at the moment the piece only places in the bottom right quadrant. Will be adding other behaviors and using some sort of identifier to determine which algorithm it should use to behave (and it will go through all behaviors in the event one behavior won't place)

Day 3 progress (about 30 minutes)
- Completed: Parsing filler_vm stdin, placing pieces of board, identifying pieces
- Incomplete: 
- In Progress: Piece placing algorithm behavior, visualizer draft
- Note - I was working on another project and also did not sleep in over 30 hours, decided to write a quick visualizer draft. Too tired to keep fixing it, why seg fault.

Day 4 progress (about 2 hours)
- Completed: Parsing filler_vm stdin, placing pieces of board, identifying pieces, visualizer
- Incomplete: 
- In Progress: Piece placing algorithm behavior
- Note - Completed the visualizer I started when I was up super late because I couldn't fall asleep. Fixed the visualizer to look nice, now aiming to work on behavior. May optimize the visualizer for faster speed.

Day 5 progress (about 3 hours)
- Completed: Parsing filler_vm stdin, placing pieces of board, identifying pieces, visualizer, filling board algorithm
- Incomplete:
- In Progress: Piece placing algorithm behavior
- Note - Had a big break on this project and some other due to birthday vacation and prepping for holiday season. I've also started up lem_in with my good friend Aneesh (https://github.com/aneeshnazar/lemin) so I will be trying to finish this project up when I have time while working on lem_in with Aneesh.

(PROJECT WENT ON BREAK FOR AWHILE)

Day 6 progress (about 6 hours)
- Completed: Parsing filler_vm stdin, placing pieces of board, identifying pieces, visualizer, filling board algorithm
- Incomplete:
- In Progress: Piece placing algorithm behavior
- Note - Had to fix a few visualizer issue and algorithm behavior, becoming more polished and faster. Trying to create behavioral patterns to win as much as possible, changing a few algorithm as well.

Day 7 progress (about 10 hours)
- Completed: Parsing filler_vm stdin, placing pieces of board, identifying pieces, visualizer, filling board algorithm, piece placing algorithm behavior
- Incomplete:
- In Progress:
- Note - Completed project, it wins at least on player one or two side on each map against each players, struggles a bit on smaller maps, otherwise works well on larger ones.
