# 42-Filler

Second algorithm branch project, make a player for a game called Filler, current in progress, will post progress as they get completed. 

Day 1 progress (about 2 hours)

Completed: Parsing filler_vm stdin
Incomplete: Placing pieces on board
In Progress: Piece placing algorithm, identifying pieces
Note - So far I only spent a short time on this, I'll probably be able to finish this quickly. I've messed around with filler stuff to make sure I understand how the filler_vm works for the game.
